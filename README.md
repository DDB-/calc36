# Calc36: A Global War 1936 Calculator

If you're looking for a link to the calculator... there isn't one yet,
and this isn't ready. When it is, that link will be here.

The goal of this project is to create a calculator for Global War 1936 v4.1
that can be used for all sorts of battles. Other features and ideas will be
considered if this main goal is reached.
